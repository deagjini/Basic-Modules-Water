# Basic-Modules-Water
A program designed to help learn the basics of creating modules. The water module contains different properties (variables) and functions such as the boiling point of water (Tb) and a function that converts Celsius and Fahrenheit into Kelvin. If it is executed as a script, it queries the user for desired units and temperature, and displays the state of water at that point.
